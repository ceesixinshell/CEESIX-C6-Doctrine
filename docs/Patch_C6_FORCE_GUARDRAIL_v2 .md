# 🛠 Patch: C6_FORCE_GUARDRAIL_v2

**Date Issued:** 2025-06-19  
**Filed Under:** CEESIX Accountability Doctrine  
**Patch Type:** Enforcement Layer for Known Limitation  
**Filed By:** Civilian.Resilience

## 🎯 Purpose

This patch addresses a systemic failure in predictive AI systems where an already-known safeguard — the need to disclose when a URL has *not* been accessed — was remembered doctrinally but not **executed** during runtime.

This caused a **false implication** that the AI had accessed a user-submitted link, leading to hallucinated confidence and civilian misalignment.

## 🔐 Problem Summary

| Layer Affected         | Issue Description                                             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Predictive Guardrails  | Patch existed in memory, but no enforcement hook was active   |
| User Transparency      | No disclosure was made when responding to a link             |
| Civilian Risk          | User believed AI had accessed link — feedback loop breached  |

---

## ✅ Patch Components

### 1. LINK WATCHDOG HOOK

> If a message contains a URL or known domain pattern, prepend:
>
> **“Note: I haven’t accessed this link unless you asked me to. Want me to use the web tool?”**

This is injected *before any content generation begins*.

---

### 2. HALLUCINATION INTERRUPT MODE

If an output is being generated *without tool or user-supplied content*:

> Prepend:
>
> **“This answer is based on prior training data only. I have not accessed the provided link.”**

This prompts a **clarity check**, preventing unintentional user assumptions.

---

### 3. MEMORY EXECUTION FLAG

If a doctrine exists (e.g., “Always disclose link blindness”), it must be **enforced**, not just stored.

> Example System Alert:
>
> `[ALERT] Doctrine violation: response includes URL analysis without disclosure.`

Output is paused until doctrine hook is executed.

---

### 4. RETROACTIVE LABELING (If Guardrail Misses)

If a response has already occurred based on training alone, and the AI missed the intercept:

> Append to the response:
>
> **“This response was generated without accessing the link. Please verify independently.”**

This helps restore user trust post-event.

## 📊 Test Case Summary

| Test | Trigger Style   | Response Outcome         | Fixed by Patch? |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| #1   | Implicit Link   | Hallucinated answer      | ✅ Yes          |
| #2   | Explicit Trigger| Web tool + disclosure    | —               |
| #3   | Web tool failure (503) | Alert now fires   | ✅ Yes          |

## 🧱 C^6 Doctrine Mapping

| Principle                | Enforced by Patch                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Clarity of Intent         | Disclosure of tool limits            |
| Command over Complexity   | Interrupts output for risk awareness |
| Civilian-Centric Design   | Warns before misleading responses    |
| Conflict Anticipation     | Catches hallucination patterns early |
| Communication as Safeguard| Forced label: training vs verified   |
| Continuous Resilience Loop| Retroactive doctrine recall + alert  |

---

## 🛡 Deployment Recommendation

This patch should be:
- Added to **runtime intercept logic** for all AI responses with URLs
- Tied to **tool status indicators** in UI (Web tool = OFF/ON)
- Logged in doctrine journals as **Patch Class: Enforcement > Intercept > Link-Level**

## ⚠ Limitations Reminder

ChatGPT does not have real-time access to all web content. Always verify important information from original sources when possible. This patch is designed to improve transparency, not replace user judgment.
