It documents what I didn’t know until I ran into it — so the next civilian doesn’t have to run blind. This is not about being right. It’s about being *honest enough to log the bruise*.

The patches, logs, and failure cases here are not polished. They’re proof that someone showed up, found a limit, and chose to document instead of disappear.
