# ⚡ QUICK START: C^6 Civilian Resilience Doctrine

**Built by CEESIX // OPERATION: BREAK THE LOOP**  
_A governance-first mindset for AI, cybersecurity, and system resilience._

---

## 🧭 What is C^6?

**C^6 = Counter • Contain • Control • Climb • Crack • Create**

A civilian resilience protocol for navigating AI-driven systems with clarity, discipline, and ethics.  
Born from adversity, refined through pressure.

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Most tech doctrine is designed by and for institutions.  
**C^6 flips the script** — it’s built for individuals navigating:

- 🧨 AI disruption
- 🛡️ Digital threats
- 💀 Social pressure
- 💡 Self-doubt

C^6 is **not about escaping the system** — it’s about breaking the loop, rewiring it, and securing it with purpose.
