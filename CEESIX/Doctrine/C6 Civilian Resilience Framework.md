# C^6 Civilian Resilience 

**C^6 = Counter, Contain, Control, Climb, Crack, Create**

This is your living doctrine. Track how each mission develops one or more of the six pillars.

- **Counter**: Recognize and resist cognitive attacks
- **Contain**: Limit blast radius from emotional/technical failures
- **Control**: Regain composure and system integrity
- **Climb**: Skill elevation through self-testing
- **Crack**: Penetrate mental or technical obstacles
- **Create**: Document, teach, deploy new methods
